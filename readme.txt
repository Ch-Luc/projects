The aim of this project is to implement in C++ the main features of the video game Balatro in order to create an app that helps the user play the most optimized hand.

Balatro is a video game based on poker principles, where the player needs to achieve a given score to advance to the next level. There are different card modifiers, allowing the player to have more than four copies of a card or to boost the score obtained by using a specific card. In addition, specific boosts such as Jokers allow the player to significantly increase their score.

/!/!/!\ THIS PROJECT IS STILL IN DEVELOPMENT /!/!/!\

The project is divided into different steps:

I - Implementation of the core principles
  1- Recognition of poker hands
  2- Computation of a score (without Jokers)
  3- Implementation of key Jokers (most impactful ones)
  4- Computation of the score with Jokers

II - Game information gathering
  1- Segmentation of a game image to gather cards and Jokers
  2- Recognition of cards and Jokers
  3- (Optional) Tools for full deck recognition and poker hand level recognition

III - Merging
  1- Creation of an application combining the two principles above
  2- Buttons for recognition
  3- Computation of the optimized hand to play
  4- (Optional) Computation of the probability of finding the most optimized hand with the remaining discards
